# Documentation

This folder contains guides and other miscellaneous documentation for nrelay.

The code in the `src/` folder has extensive inline documentation through the use of JSDoc comments. One of the best ways to explore this documentation is by using a code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which utilises these comments to provide a rich intellisense experience.

If you prefer to read through the documentation online, or simply need a quick reference, the entire inline documentation is also available at [docs.nrelay.net](https://docs.nrelay.net/)
